Auto-Clicker made with the AutoHotKey v2 scripting language


    prerequisite: have AutoHotKey v2 installed

Running:
    
      Run file


Actions:
  
    Ctrl + q : Toggle for whether or not auto clicking is enabled
        - switch from able to auto click, to not able to autoclick, or vice versa
  
  
    Ctrl + f : If autoclicking is enabled (see above) starts autoclicking
               If autoclicking is NOT enabled, does nothing
  
    Ctrl + i : quits the file

  To STOP autoclicking you must disable autoclicking with Ctrl + q
  To RE-ENABLE autoclicking you must enable autoclicking with Ctrl + q



  This project does not go very into depth on the concept or code. It was only something small I tried to test autohotkey.
